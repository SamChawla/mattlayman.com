## Stream software development on Twitch

I'm regularly streaming on {{< extlink "https://www.twitch.tv/mblayman" "Twitch" >}}.
On most Wednesday nights at 9pm Eastern time,
I'm streaming on Twitch
to build my Software as a Service called {{< extlink "https://www.collegeconductor.com/" "College Conductor" >}}.
During the stream,
I work on Python and Django
to add new features to my SaaS product.
My primary goal is to teach others how to build complex web projects
and all the skills that they'll need to produce something
that's more than a tutorial app.

Want to check it out?
I post the streams on YouTube
at the {{< extlink "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzDsImiO7b8&list=PLFcKEo4b_n1wQA6lKtSqCq1dTMq1c2Lmw" "Building SaaS with Python and Django" >}} playlist.

## Full Health Developer

I run <a href="https://fullhealthdeveloper.com/" target="_blank">Full Health Developer</a>.
Full Health Developer is a website
with a mission to help developers
improve their physical and mental health.

I research topics that are relevant to software developers
and deliver that information in long form articles.
The site covers topics like focus, repetitive stress injury, and nutrition.

## Frederick Technology

Frederick is a lovely small city
to the Northwest
of Washington, D.C.
I'm involved
in the technology scene
to find community
and foster a love of tech
among my fellow citizens.

* I started
  <a href="https://www.pythonfrederick.org/" target="_blank">Python Frederick</a>
  in 2015
  and continue to organize it
  (with some fantastic co-organizers).
* I helped coordinate the city's first
  <a href="https://www.hackfrederick.com/" target="_blank">Hackathon</a>.
* Through my efforts
  on a team of tech volunteers,
  we earned Frederick a finalist spot
  in Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/stateandlocal/cityonacloud/2017finalists/" target="_blank">2017 City on a Cloud Innovation Challenge</a>.

I care deeply about my home,
and I push hard to make sure
that its citizens have the opportunity to learn
about technology.

<a name='projects'></a>
## Open Source

I enjoy spending time
on many open source projects.
Some are my own.
Some are the work of many.
All are fun.

### Django REST Framework JSON API

In 2017,
I picked up the torch
as the maintainer
of the <a href="https://github.com/django-json-api/django-rest-framework-json-api" target="_blank">Django REST Framework JSON API</a>
package.
This package translates
Django REST Framework API output
into the <a href="http://jsonapi.org/" target="_blank">JSON API</a> format.

### tappy

Automated software testing is generally useful,
and the <a href="http://testanything.org/" target="_blank">Test Anything Protocol (TAP)</a>
is a way to track those automated results.
I wrote
<a href="https://github.com/python-tap" target="_blank">a set of TAP generators for Python</a>
that hook in with Python's testing ecosystem.
The core project is called `tappy`.

  <div class="about-text">
    <p>
I’m currently a senior software engineer
at {{< extlink "https://doctorondemand.com/" "Doctor on Demand" >}}.
Doctor on Demand connects patients to doctors
with video calls
to solve common health problems.
I write code using Django
to make the patient experience
as good as it can be.

<div class="about-section about-section-reverse">
  <div class="about-text">
    <p>
I worked at <a href="https://storybird.com" target="_blank">Storybird</a>.
Storybird makes it possible for people to share creative stories
through book and poetry writing.
I was the lead software engineer
with the opportunity to make Storybird an even better place to share stories.
I got to write Python and JavaScript every day
and help make the internet more awesome.

<a href="https://lockheedmartin.com/" target="_blank">Lockheed Martin</a> was my employer.
While there, I worked on a wide range of products.
You might have heard of some of them,
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#Control_segment" target="_blank">GPS</a>
or <a href="https://www.iridium.com/network/iridium-next/" target="_blank">satellite phones</a>.
I also gained experience with Modeling and Simulation software,
web applications,
and complex configuration management.

<a name='family'></a>
## Family

I am a family man.
I consider myself blessed to have a loving wife, Elease, and
two great kids, Mark and Faye.
My children are young so my life is a
little hectic, but that's perfectly fine with me.

<a name='church'></a>
## Church

I am a Christian, and I attend <a href="http://newhopeopc.org/" target="_blank">New Hope OPC</a>.
My hope is that my faith reflects on all of my behavior, and that I show kindness,
humility, and love.
