I’m Matt, a software creator. Here are things I do:

## Consult on the Django web framework

With over a decade of web development experience,
I consult on the {{< extlink "https://www.djangoproject.com/" "Django" >}} web framework.
If your team needs Django training,
please reach out to me on {{< extlink "https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattlayman/" "LinkedIn" >}}.

## Build apps on Twitch

I'm regularly streaming on {{< extlink "https://www.twitch.tv/mblayman" "Twitch" >}}.
On most Wednesday nights at 9pm Eastern time,
I'm streaming on Twitch
to build a Django application.
My primary goal is to teach others how to build complex web projects
and all the skills that they'll need to produce something
that's more than a tutorial app.

Want to check it out?
I post the streams on YouTube
at the {{< extlink "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzDsImiO7b8&list=PLFcKEo4b_n1wQA6lKtSqCq1dTMq1c2Lmw" "Building SaaS with Python and Django" >}} playlist.

## Frederick Technology

Frederick is a lovely small city
to the Northwest
of Washington, D.C.
I'm involved
in the technology scene
to find community
and foster a love of tech
among my fellow citizens.

* I started
  {{< extlink "https://www.pythonfrederick.org/" "Python Frederick" >}}
  in 2015
  and continue to organize it
  (with some fantastic co-organizers).
* I helped coordinate the city's first
  {{< extlink "https://www.hackfrederick.com/" "Hackathon" >}}.
* Through my efforts
  on a team of tech volunteers,
  we earned Frederick a finalist spot
  in Amazon's
  {{< extlink "https://aws.amazon.com/stateandlocal/cityonacloud/2017finalists/" "2017 City on a Cloud Innovation Challenge" >}}.

I care deeply about my home,
and I push hard to make sure
that its citizens have the opportunity to learn
about technology.

## Open Source

I enjoy spending time
on many open source projects.
These days I'm mostly working
on Django apps,
but I've maintained some open source projects
and still work on some of them today.

### Django REST Framework JSON API

In 2017,
I picked up the torch
as the maintainer
of the
{{< extlink "https://github.com/django-json-api/django-rest-framework-json-api" "Django REST Framework JSON API" >}}
package.
This package translates
Django REST Framework API output
into the
{{< extlink "http://jsonapi.org/" "JSON API" >}} format.

### tappy

Automated software testing is generally useful,
and the
{{< extlink "http://testanything.org/" "Test Anything Protocol (TAP)" >}}
is a way to track those automated results.
I wrote
{{< extlink "https://github.com/python-tap" "a set of TAP generators for Python" >}}
that hook in with Python's testing ecosystem.
The core project is called `tappy`.

I’m currently the software architect
at {{< extlink "https://doctorondemand.com/" "Doctor on Demand" >}}.
Doctor on Demand connects patients to doctors
with video calls
to solve common health problems.
I write code using Django
to make the patient experience
as good as it can be.

I worked at <a href="https://storybird.com" target="_blank">Storybird</a>.
Storybird makes it possible for people to share creative stories
through book and poetry writing.
I was the lead software engineer
with the opportunity to make Storybird an even better place to share stories.
I got to write Python and JavaScript every day
and help make the internet more awesome.

<a href="https://lockheedmartin.com/" target="_blank">Lockheed Martin</a> was my employer.
While there, I worked on a wide range of products.
You might have heard of some of them,
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#Control_segment" target="_blank">GPS</a>
or <a href="https://www.iridium.com/network/iridium-next/" target="_blank">satellite phones</a>.
I also gained experience with Modeling and Simulation software,
web applications,
and complex configuration management.

## Family

I am a family man.
I consider myself blessed to have a loving wife, Elease, and
two great kids, Mark and Faye.
My children are young so my life is a
little hectic, but that's perfectly fine with me.

## Church

I am a Christian, and I attend <a href="http://newhopeopc.org/" target="_blank">New Hope OPC</a>.
My hope is that my faith reflects on all of my behavior, and that I show kindness,
humility, and love.
