title: "Consistent Python code with Black"
description: >-
  Code is read far more than it is written.
  By using a consistent style,
  the readability of a project can improve dramatically.
  This post focuses on Black, a code formatter,
  how it can improve your project's code style,
  and how you or your team can use it.

Code formatting is the subject
of millions of fiery, nerdy debates.
Developers love to argue
about code style
because we read code a lot.
The style matters because it affects readability.

We have examples of communities
that benefit from a shared code style.

* The Go programming language has `gofmt` (i.e., "go format")
  baked in as a core tool in the language.
  Their core team decided on a set
  of rules to use
  and everyone gets the benefit
  of reading code that looks very similar.
  {{< extlink "https://blog.golang.org/go-fmt-your-code" "Learn more" >}}
* The Python community rallied
  behind {{< extlink "https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" "PEP 8" >}}
  as the guide
  for what Python code should aspire to.
  PEP 8 adds a level of consistency
  which makes moving from one project to another feel natural.

If we drill into the Python example,
we can see a difference
compared to Go.
`gofmt` is a *tool* that will automatically fix style errors.
PEP 8 is a *style guide*.
It is **not** a tool.
The consequence of focusing
on a style guide
instead of a tool
is that it's possible to have inconsistent code.

Generally,
the community answer to making
PEP 8-style code was to use a lint tool
like:

* {{< extlink "http://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/" "pycodestyle" >}} (formerly call pep8)
* {{< extlink "http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/" "flake8" >}}
  (flake8 is a wrapper that bundles pycodestyle
  and {{< extlink "https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/" "pyflakes" >}} together).

These tools *report* the problems,
but do not fix them.
This puts the burden
on the developer to fix the code.[^1]
A tool to *fix* style issues is a task perfectly suited
for a computer to do automatically!

[^1]: This is not a knock on pycodestyle or flake8.
      I have been a happy user of flake8 for years and I'm glad it exists.

> **What happens when a project
adopts a tool that *automatically*
sets the code style?**

Now is the perfect time to introduce {{< extlink "https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" "Black" >}}.

*Black is like `gofmt` for Python.*
While it's not a tool that is officially endorsed
by the Python core team,
it does automatically format code.

Black's formatting rules are a superset of PEP 8.
If you choose to use Black,
you get PEP 8 compliance for free,
plus some other style choices
that the Black team sees as helpful
for making maintainable code.

The Black team touts the tool
as "The Uncompromising Code Formatter."
Practically, this means that Black comes
with very few configuration options
to affect the style.
Limiting options for code formatting is A Good Thing‚Ñ¢.
With few options,
code from project to project
that is Black formatted looks **very** similar.

By using Black,
we get the benefit of code that is similar
which allows us to focus more
on the content
than trip over unfamiliar styling choices.

> Commonly formatted code aids our brains
to focus on the problem
and code solution,
rather than get distracted by code structure
and minor stylistic differences.

## Using Black

To get started with the tool,
install it with `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install black
```

I'd recommend installing Python packages
into a virtual environment
using {{< extlink "https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" "venv" >}}.
You could also use a tool
like {{< extlink "https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" "Pipenv" >}}
to help you manage your Python project.

Once Black is installed,
you will have a new command line tool
called `black`
available to you
in your shell,
and you're ready to start!

(One word of caution before you try this yourself:
Black *will* change your code files.
If you only want to experiment with this,
I strongly encourage you to use a version control tool
like {{< extlink "https://git-scm.com/" "Git" >}}
or work from a copy.)

Black can work on individual files
or entire directories of Python code.

```bash
$ black my_file.py
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file left unchanged.

$ black my_package/
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
108 file left unchanged.
```

Emoji. Cute.

When Black has nothing to change, the output is short and direct.
When Black changes code,
it summarizes the changes concisely.

```bash
$ black my_package/
reformatted /Users/matt/projects/my_package/some_file.py
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file reformatted, 107 files left unchanged.
```

I really like this output
because it tells me everything that I might care about
and leaves out noise
that often sneak into tools like this.

It's nice to run Black
from the command line,
but it would be even better to run straight
from your editor.
Thankfully, the documentation covers
{{< extlink "https://github.com/ambv/black#editor-integration" "editor configuration" >}}
for many popular editors
(including my fav, Vim!).

After I installed the Black plugin for Vim, I modified my `vimrc`
to format on save
and I could immediately benefit from formatted code.

```vim
" Run Black on save.
autocmd BufWritePre *.py execute ':Black'
```

## Using Black on a team

The previous section looked at how to use Black
on a personal level.
How could a team
of developers
working on a project
use Black together?
Let's consider two topics:

1. Black in Continuous Integration (CI)
2. Black as a Git pre-commit hook

### Black in Continuous Integration (CI)

If you're working on a team
to develop a software project
and you're *not* using Continuous Integration,
then (please!) consider using a service
like
{{< extlink "https://travis-ci.org/" "Travis CI" >}}
or
{{< extlink "https://circleci.com/" "Circle CI" >}}.
After a bit of setup,
Continuous Integration tools and services
can save so much time
by checking for bugs,
running your tests automatically,
and building your code.

One great use of CI is for lint checking.
Lint is a category of software issues
that automated tools are really good at reporting.

Can you guess where this is going?
Black has a mode
that directly supports CI checking!

```bash
$ black --check my_package/
would reformat /Users/matt/projects/my_package/some_file.py
All done! üí• üíî üí•
1 file would be reformatted, 107 files would be left unchanged.
```

If you add Black to a CI build process
with the `--check` option,
the tool will report any code
that does not adhere to the code format
and fail the CI build.
This may not sound like a good thing,
but it is!

The check option helps ensure
that the team produces consistently styled code.
It is a guard
that can keep code quality high.

### Black as a Git pre-commit hook

Git can run special scripts
at various places in the Git workflow
(which the system calls "hooks").
These scripts can do whatever you want
and, in theory, can help a team
with their development flow.

I used to think these hooks were not very useful to teams.
My belief stemmed from a team's inability
to add these hook scripts
to version control
in a way that would apply the scripts
for every team member.

Then I found {{< extlink "https://pre-commit.com/" "pre-commit" >}}.
pre-commit makes hook scripts extremely accessible to teams. How?

```bash
$ pre-commit install
```

With that one command, pre-commit installs everything a developer needs
to make hooks accessible
at a team level.
`pre-commit install` is a bootstrapping command
that inserts all the necessary scripts
to let pre-commit manage it all.

After the install command executes,
pre-commit will use a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file
to make decisions
about what to do
at the various Git hook points.

This gives power to a team since `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
can be added to source control
and the team can make shared configuration choices.

One of those configurations choices is...
drumroll please...
Black configuration!
The details of this setup are explained
in the {{< extlink "https://github.com/ambv/black#version-control-integration" "Version control integration" >}} section
of the documentation,
but the short version is
to add the following to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/ambv/black
    rev: stable
    hooks:
    - id: black
      language_version: python3.7
```

For any developer with pre-commit installed,
commiting with Git will generate output like:

```bash
$ git commit
black....................................................................Failed
hookid: black

Files were modified by this hook. Additional output:

reformatted my_package/some_file.py
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file reformatted.
```

It's nice to catch code formatting problems in CI,
and it's even nicer to catch them
before your code is committed to source control!

### Paint it Black

In this post,
I showed you how you can use Black
to format your code.
It's hard to express the value
of consistent code formatting
unless you've worked
on a team,
but I hope you can imagine the benefits
of a shared style.

When using a tool for yourself,
Black helps you review *your own* code
in the future
and have a consistent experience.
To that end,
we looked at how to set up the tool
on your own.

Since the greatest benefits come for teams,
I focused on two separate ways
that teams can build Black
into their workflow.

* Using Black in continuous integration can keep code style consistent
  before it is merged on a master branch.
* Using Black with pre-commit hooks for version control can keep style consistent
  before it is even committed to a repository.

Both of these patterns are effective ways
to manage a team's code style.

I think Black is a really great way
to let software make our job
as Python developers easier
so I hope you'll check it out!
