title: Pipfile and pipenv
description: >-
  Python has many methods
  to manage software package dependencies.
  The Python Packaging Authority proposed a new standard format
  called a Pipfile.
  This post includes the Python Frederick video presentation
  about Pipfiles
  that I presented
  in August 2017.

Last month,
I wrote
in detail
about {{< extlink "https://www.mattlayman.com/2017/using-pipfile-for-fun-and-profit.html" "the new Pipfile format and the pipenv tool" >}}
for managing Python packages.
I presented about Pipfiles
in depth
at Python Frederick this month.

If audio and video is more your speed,
we recorded a talk
for the first time
at Python Frederick,
and I posted it to YouTube
for your enjoyment.

The presentation material is available
in the {{< extlink "https://github.com/python-frederick/talks/tree/master/2017-08-pipfile" "Python Frederick talks repository" >}}.
