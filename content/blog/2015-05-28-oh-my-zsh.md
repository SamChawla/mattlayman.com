title: Oh, my shell? Oh My Zsh
description: >-
  If you spend a lot of time on a Linux or Mac terminal,
  you may be familiar with bash,
  the shell program that your terminal uses
  by default.
  In this post,
  we will look at Zsh,
  an alternative shell,
  and some of the amazing benefits
  that it can offer over bash.

Do you ever think about what program is running your terminal?
For a long time,
I knew the answer for most Linux / OS X systems was {{< extlink "http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" "bash" >}},
a {{< extlink "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29" "shell" >}} program.
*But what else is available?*

Aside from the occasional script,
I didn't pay much attention to bash.
bash helped me get around my computer
and autocomplete stuff,
and that felt like enough.
This was **profoundly** shortsighted.

Heavy command line users should think about their shell.
I finally devoted time to shell research,
and I became a {{< extlink "http://www.zsh.org/" "Zsh" >}} convert.

Zsh is the power user's weapon of choice.
It has an amazing {{< extlink "http://www.slideshare.net/jaguardesignstudio/why-zsh-is-cooler-than-your-shell-16194692" "set of features" >}} that go far beyond bash.
For example, `cd ~/p/h` followed by a tab
will quickly expand to `cd ~/projects/handroll/`
on my computer.
Zsh is smart enough to determine what you mean
when you want to change directories
so you can type fewer characters.

On top of Zsh being awesome, it also has some great tools
to extend its awesomeness.
One popular tool for the shell is {{< extlink "http://ohmyz.sh/" "Oh My Zsh" >}}.
OMZ offers many plugins and themes that make Zsh excel even more.
I've added the `git` and `virtualenvwrapper` plugins to my setup,
and they've already been a huge boon.
There are hundreds more.

Want to try out Zsh? Go for it with these commands:

```console
$ sudo apt-get install zsh
$ chsh -s /bin/zsh # Change shell to zsh.
$ curl -L \
    https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh | sh
```
