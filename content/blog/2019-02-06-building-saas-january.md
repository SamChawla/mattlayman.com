### Completing a 3rd party integration

We spent some weeks in December
building a 3rd party integration
into College Conductor (the SaaS project that the stream focuses on).

This episode was the bow on top
to finish off the integration.

### Creating an admin dashboard

The next focus in the stream
is building some tools
to help with backend tasks.
Before we can do that,
we need a home for those tools to live
so in this episode,
I showed how to build an admin dashboard
to keep tools for user with extra privileges.

### Semi-automated tasks

In this episode,
we hooked a tool into our new admin dashboard
that would help with decision making
of some data processing.

We built a view to display the data for the tool
and discussed how writing a little bit of code can save huge chunks
of time
for tasks that might otherwise take many hours
of manual effort.

### Automation aides

This episode completes the automation tool
that we started
in the previous week.

I showed how to generate HTML forms pre-populated
with all the right information
from the data
to transform our tedious task at hand
into something that can be completed with a few mouse clicks.

All of these streams are designed
with teaching in mind.

I happily take viewer questions
and do my best to answer them.
See you on Twitch.
