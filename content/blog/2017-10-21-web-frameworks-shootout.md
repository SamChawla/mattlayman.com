At October's Python Frederick presentation,
I looked at 5 popular Python web frameworks
and discussed the benefits and tradeoffs
of each of these tools.
The video is available on YouTube
for you to view.

These were the 5 web frameworks that we compared:

* {{< extlink "https://github.com/encode/apistar" "API Star" >}}
* {{< extlink "http://falconframework.org/" "Falcon" >}}
* {{< extlink "http://flask.pocoo.org/" "Flask" >}}
* {{< extlink "https://www.djangoproject.com/" "Django" >}}
* {{< extlink "https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/" "Pyramid" >}}

The presentation material is available
in the {{< extlink "https://github.com/python-frederick/talks/tree/master/2017-10-web-frameworks" "Python Frederick talks repository" >}}.

Additionally,
the sample code for each framework can be downloaded
from GitHub
in a specific {{< extlink "https://github.com/mblayman/web-framework-shootout" "web frameworks repository" >}}.
