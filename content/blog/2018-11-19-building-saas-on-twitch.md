I started streaming on {{< extlink "https://www.twitch.tv/mblayman" "Twitch" >}}.
The stream covers how to build a Software as a Service (SaaS)
with Python using Django.

> The stream runs at 9pm Eastern time on Wednesday most weeks.

I show developers
how to build a site
that is more complex
than a tutorial.
We look at:

* Designing and creating pages for users
* How to create automated tests for the code
* Making background jobs that handle business processes
* Deploying code and infrastructure development

During the stream,
we're working on {{< extlink "https://www.collegeconductor.com/" "College Conductor" >}}.
College Conductor is a SaaS
for people in college admissions.
I have no expectation for people to understand the problem space
so I make sure to provide context
for whatever I'm working on that evening.

What can **you** expect to get out of it?

* The chance to ask questions to someone with over a decade
  of Python experience
* The opportunity to learn about popular web frameworks and tools
  like Django, Bootstrap, and Ansible
* What it takes to manage a website on your own

What if you can't watch live? **No problem!**
I'm also posting the streams
onto {{< extlink "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFcKEo4b_n1wQA6lKtSqCq1dTMq1c2Lmw" "YouTube" >}}
after the session is over.
My goal is to build a catalog
of useful content for people who want to learn.

I'm learning rapidly how to be a better broadcaster
so I hope you'll join me for the ride.
As someone who has worked on websites
with millions of members,
I've got enough experience
to show developers web application development
in a real world context.

See you on the {{< extlink "https://www.twitch.tv/mblayman" "stream" >}}!
