Technology books are more like milk than wine. They don't get better with age.
Brad Ediger's *{{< extlink "http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Rails-Brad-Ediger/dp/0596510322" "Advanced Rails" >}}* is
fairly well written and provides lots of details, but much of the information
is outdated. Ruby on Rails has changed. The plugin ecosystem of Ruby gems has
changed. Even the underlying Ruby language has changed.

Ediger used detailed examples to explain advanced Ruby on Rails concepts. Oh,
did I mention they were detailed? Yeah, *lots* of details. If I had just bought
the book in 2008 and was building a Rails web applications, then those examples
may have been **super** helpful. But I read this in 2014 and did not find the
information helpful. *Advanced Rails* covers a good list of topics including
security, RESTful web services, performance optimization, and
internationalization, but it isn't worth slogging through pages of coding
details for projects that have probably changed significantly or are no longer
influential in the ecosystem.

I would not recommend reading *Advanced Rails*. It has curdled.
