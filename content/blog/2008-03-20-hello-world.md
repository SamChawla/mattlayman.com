This is my first blog post,
and since it’s my first post,
I’d like to explain the purpose of my blog.

My great adventure into the blogosphere will probably have a distinctive slant
toward all things Python.
I intend to journal my experience
with my involvement
on the Entertainer Media Center project.
Entertainer is written in Python,
a dynamically typed language
that I’ve spent some time with over the last couple of months.

As someone who uses Perl for development in his day job,
my brief impression of Python is amazement at its elegance and readability.
Python has already showed me how easy stuff like unit testing
and Test Driven Development can be.
But that’s a subject for another post.
I don’t want to drone on already, so I’ll stop here.

Thanks for reading.
