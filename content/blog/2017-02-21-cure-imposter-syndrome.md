At every stage of our careers,
we are learners.
No matter how much an individual accomplishes,
there will always be more to learn and do.
This truth is bound to leave people
with a feeling that they have missing knowledge.
My understanding of Imposter Syndrome
is that people latch onto these kinds of feelings
and can translate that to anxiety
and other self-destructive forces.
I'm certainly not a psychologist,
but I can offer this advice
to software developers
who are feeling inadequate
with their experience
(including myself):

> Remember to be humble.

Humility is hugely powerful.
It can take negative feelings
about how you picture yourself
and transform them
into an acceptance
of who you are as a person.
*A humble attitude relieves you
of the imaginary requirement
that you must be the best
at whatever you pursue.*

Humility does not mean
that you give up your ambition.
It's perfectly reasonable to strive
for excellence.
I think humility allows you to follow
those goals
while escaping from an arrival fallacy.
Because the truth is that you'll never arrive at everything.
In fact,
there's a good chance you may never arrive
at *anything*.
The world is a huge place
and being the *sharpest* tip of the spear
on some subject matter
is extremely unlikely
given all the intelligent people in the world.

With a humble stance,
a term like "novice" or "beginner"
loses the stigma that it might otherwise have.
I think it's impossible to feel like an imposter
when you embrace a position
that naturally has tons of upward mobility
because you'll know that you can always grow more.

This attitude even applies
when you're extremely proficient at something.
Much emphasis is placed
on "high achievers"
who still manage to feel like frauds.
I'd speculate that much
of this inadequacy
stems from natural challenges
in a work environment.
At work,
developers are asked
to solve problems
with no previous solution.
There is a good chance
that a solution will require novel composition
of different ideas or technologies.
And we know that synthesis of different ideas is hard.
Like, *really hard*.
Naturally,
if a developer is proficient
at one half of a solution
but not the other half,
those fradulent feelings may creep in.
Again,
a humble mindset
will be a boon
to this developer.
The mindset should set upon a developer
the thought of
"I guess this is where I need to grow."

Everything I've discussed are merely my thoughts
on this subject.
Humility is the strategy
that I choose
when dealing with my own humanity
and my path in life.
I hope that a humble attitude
can help some of you who may struggle
with your sense of self
in your work.
Good luck to you.
