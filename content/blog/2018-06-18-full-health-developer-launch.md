I launched a new website devoted to developer health
called
[Full Health Developer](https://fullhealthdeveloper.com/).
The site focuses on physical and mental health topics
that are relevant to software developers.

Toward the beginning of the year,
I surveyed meetups in the Washington D.C. area
to find out the issues that developers think about
concerning their health.

The survey responses mentioned what you might expect
from a health survey:

* Unable to get to a gym
* Hard time maintaining good nutrition
* Bad sleep habits

There were also topics closer to developers:

* Bad posture from typing frequently
* Overtaxing work culture
* Stress from job deadlines

Equipped with this knowledge,
I set out to make a site
that could be a resource
for developers.

Since I'm a developer,
I thought
"What do I like about websites?"
Using my own experience
as a benchmark
for what might make a good site,
I settled on these qualities:

* **Interesting data and stories**
* **Uncluttered user interface**
* **Longer content where I can steep my thoughts**
* **Links to resources where I can learn more**

My mission was to make a site that *I* would like to read.

After a few months of setup, research, and writing,
I created Full Health Developer.
Full Health Developer is two primary things:

1. A website where developers can learn
   how to improve their physical and mental health.
2. An email newsletter where developers can do the same thing.

Some developers have a very strong distaste for email
and email subscriptions.
While I respect their point of view,
my research shows that mailing lists lead to highly engaged audiences
so I want a list to be an option.

With Full Health Developer,
I plan to release the same long form articles
to both the website
and to the mailing list.
My hope is that those who dislike lists can ignore the FHD list
if they choose.

Speaking of articles, the first content article is available.
You can check out
[The Sleepy Developer: How Sleep Affects Your Code](https://fullhealthdeveloper.com/how-sleep-affects-your-code)
on the site.

If you like what you read,
I'd love to hear about it!
If you *don't* like what you read,
I'd *also* love to hear about it.
Community feedback will help me make the site better
for everyone.

Full Health Developer sits nicely at an intersection
of software development
and physical and mental health.
I'm hoping it will be a valuable resource
for a long time to come.
Please check it out!
