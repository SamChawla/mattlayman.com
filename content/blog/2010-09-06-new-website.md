I just spent a lot of time setting up a website at http://matthewlayman.dyndns.org and,
wow, it was a lot of work.
If you ever want to learn a lot in a short amount of time,
try starting a local webserver on your home network.
I learned about Apache, web hosting, DDNS, DMZ, port forwarding, lynx, Planet!,
Google Picasaâ€™s data API, jQuery, and DynDNS.

The site is running on an ancient desktop from 2002,
but itâ€™s only serving a static HTML page that has some dynamic content to load stuff
from elsewhere on the Internet.
Hopefully it wonâ€™t fall over from all the imminent server load. ðŸ˜‰

Thanks to {{< extlink "http://paulhummer.org/" "Paul Hummer" >}} for pointing me at DynDNS.
I thought I was stuck.
