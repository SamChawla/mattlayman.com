My pet project, MarkWiki, has reached a point of maturity where other people
may actually be interested in using it. I started writing MarkWiki back in May
as a way to keep my Python skills sharp, but it appears to be a capable tool
now.

MarkWiki is a wiki that uses the Markdown plain text formatting language.
Markdown let's you do things in plain text like adding \* to a word like
\*boom\* to italicize it. The source text gets converted into pretty HTML.

In this release, I added user authentication so not every person on the
Internet can delete anything they want on your MarkWiki site. The release also
incorporates Bootstrap 3 so all pages are now completely mobile responsive.

You can check out the docs at
[http://pythonhosted.org/MarkWiki/](http://pythonhosted.org/MarkWiki/) or lend
a hand on [GitHub](https://github.com/mblayman/markwiki). Other features for
the release are in the release notes.

Or... if you're like me, you can play around with it:

```console
$ pip install MarkWiki
```
