  Given how much content I put online,
  I've decided to create a Patreon account.
  If you'd like to financially support me
  with a few dollars,
  I'm extremely grateful.

I like to teach on the internet.

Since 2008,
I've made content to explain things
that I've learned,
review books that I've read,
or share my thoughts.

In the last couple of years,
I've upped my game.
Instead of short articles,
my content is now long form,
and I spend a lot of time producing each one.

Additionally,
I record the Building SaaS with Python and Django stream
on Twitch.
On that stream,
I share my collected knowledge
from doing web development for the better part
of a decade.

Given all that,
I decided to make {{< extlink "https://www.patreon.com/mblayman" "a Patreon page" >}}
in case readers or viewers would like
to support me financially
in a small way.

I've added three tiers that people can give at:

1. Tip Jar - $3/month
2. The Regulars - $5/month
3. Superheroes - $15/month

The goal of my Patreon account is to turn that money around
and invest in producing better content.
I'd like to add better lighting,
camera,
editing equipment,
and other items that will let me produce a higher quality stream.

If you're able to help me, that's awesome! Thank you so much.

And if you're not, don't sweat it!
I'll still be here,
trying my best to teach what I've learned.

Here's the short video that I put on my Patreon page
which conveys the same sentiment
as my words above.
