## Learn about Python and more!

You can join my newsletter and get access
to a wide variety of useful topics
to help you learn more about software development.

On my list, I send out information about:

* **Python!** -
    I love Python and like to write in-depth articles
    on a wide variety of Python subjects.
* **Software development** -
    As a software engineer,
    I write about how to code
    on a team
    and work with other developers.
* **Developer health** -
    I care deeply about personal health
    and the intersection with software development.
    I occasionally write articles
    to inform developers
    about specific health issues
    in our industry.

I believe in having a strong signal-to-noise ratio,
so the list is low frequency
with long form, high quality content.
