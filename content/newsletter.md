## Learn about Python and more!

You can join my newsletter and get access
to a wide variety of useful topics
to help you learn more about software development.

On my list, I send out information about:

* **Django** -
    I'm a heavy user
    of the Django web framework
    and spend a lot of my time writing
    about Django
    and packages related to Django.
* **Python!** -
    I love Python and like to write in-depth articles
    on a wide variety of Python subjects.
* **Software development** -
    As a software engineer,
    I write about how to code
    on a team
    and work with other developers.

I believe in having a strong signal-to-noise ratio,
so the list is low frequency
with long form, high quality content.
