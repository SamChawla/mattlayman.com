In this episode, I worked on more customer requests
to refine the user interface. We added a new convenient shortcut button
and included additional information and links on the course detail view.

I'm continuing on my path
to include the changes
that my customer wants
as she running a school year
for the first time.

The first change was to add a new button
on the student's view
of a course.
The button added the ability to create a new task
for a course.

The second change was a change
to the course detail page.
My customer wanted the ability
to see what student's are enrolled
in a course
on the course detail page.
We had to fetch new data
for the context,
then render the information in a loop.

Finally,
I finished off the stream
with exploring how to improve the flow
for deletion of a task.
I worked through some changes,
but I ultimately didn't like where it was going
so I undid the change
and talked about what I may do
in the future
to fix the problem
in a better way.
