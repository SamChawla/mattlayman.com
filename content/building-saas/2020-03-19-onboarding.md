In this episode, we did some design work
to plan out the onboarding flow for new users.
I spoke through my design process,
outlined what a new user will need to do to succeed,
wrote down the plan in GitHub issues, then started to implement that flow.

I started the stream
with a quick fix
to the main app view.

After that,
we started a new project
in the app.
I needed to design the starting experience
for a user.

I explained to the stream all
of the data that a user needs
to be successful
with the app.
We looked at `django-extensions`
and the graph of all the models
that it can produce.

After we had the data in mind,
I listed the steps required
to get that minimal set of data.
We put all those ideas
into GitHub
and put together a GitHub milestone
to track the work.

Once the work was set,
we got started
on the onboarding flow.
We finished the stream
by connecting that onboarding starting point
to the signup page.
