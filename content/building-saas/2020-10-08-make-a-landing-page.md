In this episode,
I added a landing page design to the app that I'm building.
By using a Tailwind CSS landing page template,
I could fit the design in with my existing CSS tools.

I showed some available templates
that I discovered
while researching
for Tailwind-based landing pages.
Once I found a decent template,
I copied the source
of sample landing page
into my index page template.

Since I copy and pasted
from the landing page,
the initial look was terrible.
The HTML markup didn't fit
with my existing design
and I needed to remold the template
to fit things in.

My first change was to fix the spacing
in my UI
so that the content
of the landing page design
fit in the right space.
After that,
I removed the extra navigation
and footers
that weren't needed
since my site already had those elements.

Once the major layout and elements
were cleaned up,
I switched to changing colors
to match up with my theme.
I spent a lot of time focusing
on the gradient
that exists in the theme.
I also cleaned up text colors
that needed to change.

The final thing I did was to look
for a hero image
that I could apply
to the top
of the page.
