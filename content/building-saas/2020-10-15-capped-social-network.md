In this episode,
I started a new project to build a different kind of social network.
This social network will contain a max number of connections
to encourage thoughtful choice when growing your personal network.
We talked MVP features and put in the basics of a Django app.

I had a wild thought
to build a social network
with a capped number of connection
in the hope
that users would choice their connections based
on people
that they really care about.
To get that idea out of my head,
I started a {{< extlink "https://github.com/mblayman/social" "social network repo" >}}.

The first part of the stream outlines the vision
behind this new network.
Then I laid out the primary rules
that would make this kind of network work.

Along the way,
we brainstormed about privacy,
access control,
viable business models,
invitations and virality,
and other topics related
to a social network.
I came up with the Minimum Viable Product
of features
that could make a compelling app.

Once we did all the design thinking,
I started a Django project.
We borrowed heavily
from my experience building the homeschool app
that I'm normally building
and got the site up
on Heroku.

In the future,
I'll be doing streams on either the homeschool app
or this new social network.
