In this episode,
we worked on the progress element
that will display in every step of the onboarding flow.
I added some labels and styled the banner using Tailwind CSS.
At the end of the stream,
we boxed in the shape of the welcome page with some placeholder elements.

The very first thing I did was insert a top bar
that was unstyled
to the top
of the welcome page.
We added some placeholder text
for each of the steps
in the onboarding flow.
After that,
I started styling the UI
until it took shape.

We talked about design elements
like color and spacing
and some aesthetic qualities
that help make a user interface feel better.

After completing a first cut
of the top bar navigation,
I shifted to the welcome page
and added vector art
and placeholder text
to give the page some life.
