  of building a Software as a Service
  using Python, the Django web framework,
  and other packages from the Django ecosystem.
  The stream runs on Wednesday at 9pm ET.

On Wednesdays
at 9pm Eastern Time,
I develop a Software as a Service (SaaS)
on {{< extlink "https://www.twitch.tv/mblayman" "Twitch" >}}.

We work with code
from whatever my current Django project is.
The stream is episodic
and covers ongoing features and problems
of the site.

> My primary goal is to **teach people about the Django web framework and Python**.

Django is a big web framework
so I share my experience
from using the project
for 5+ years.

This page contains show notes
and links to each stream.
