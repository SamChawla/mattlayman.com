  Building SaaS is a weekly Twitch stream
  that works through the gritty details
  of building a Software as a Service
  using Python, the Django web framework,
  and other packages from the Django ecosystem.
  The stream runs on Wednesday at 9pm ET.

On Wednesdays
at 9pm Eastern Time,
I develop a Software as a Service (SaaS)
on {{< extlink "https://www.twitch.tv/mblayman" "Twitch" >}}.

We work with code
from my Django-based SaaS product,
{{< extlink "https://www.collegeconductor.com/" "College Conductor" >}}.
The stream is episodic
and covers ongoing features and problems
of the site.

> My primary goal is to **teach people about the Django web framework and Python**.

Django is a big web framework
so I share my experience
from using the project
for 5+ years.

Since College Conductor is a full service
with more features
than a Django demo site,
I can work
on challenges
that people won't see
when reading the Django docs
(even though the docs are great).

This page contains show notes
and links to each stream.
