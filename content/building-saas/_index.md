title: "Building SaaS with Python and Django"
aliases:

On Wednesdays
at 9pm Eastern Time,
I develop a Software as a Service (SaaS)
on {{< extlink "https://www.twitch.tv/mblayman" "Twitch" >}}.

We work through code
from my Django based SaaS product,
{{< extlink "https://www.collegeconductor.com/" "College Conductor" >}}.
The stream is episodic,
and we work through ongoing features and problems
of the site.
I have two goals:

1. Teach people about Django and Python.
    Django is a big project
    so I try to explain what I know
    from working with the web framework
    for 5+ years.
2. Make progress on my side project.

Since College Conductor is a functioning service
and has more features
than a standard Django demo site,
I'm able to work
on challenges
that people may not see
when reading through the Django docs
(even though the docs are fabulous).

This page contains show notes
and links to each stream.
Join me live if you're interested!
