As a software developer,
I use a lot of computer-related gear.
This page lists all
of my favorite gear
that I think is relevant
for me
and I personally recommend for **you**.

Hopefully,
you find something awesome
on this list
that you can incorporate
into your own setup!

## Computer Gear

Let's get right to it.
As a software developer,
it would be silly for me to start anywhere
but the computer stuff
that I use to interface
with the tech world.

### MacBook Pro 15-inch (2014-era)

<a target="_blank" href="https://support.apple.com/kb/sp704?locale=en_US"><img src="https://support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/SP704/SP704-display_mbp_15-mul_2x.png" alt="MacBook Pro 15 in"></a>

I've had a MacBook Pro since I started working
from home back in 2014.
The machine is super well designed,
and I can't bring myself
to buy a new model because I value physical keys
over the touch bar on new MacBooks.

### Kinesis Advantage 2

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Advantage2-Ergonomic-Keyboard-KB600/dp/B01KR1C5PY/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=1GGG1RQNOEANW&dchild=1&keywords=kinesis+advantage+2&qid=1611547805&sprefix=kineses%2Caps%2C164&sr=8-3&linkCode=li3&tag=mblayman-20&linkId=4b8d82fbeedc0c92023758a61be78593&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01KR1C5PY&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=mblayman-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mblayman-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B01KR1C5PY" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

A few years ago,
I started to have wrist issues.
As a developer,
this is pretty scary
since my hands are vital
to what I do for work.

I bought the {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3phTrJz" "Kinesis Advantage 2" >}} primarily
because of the split keyboard layout.
The keyboard takes some adjustment,
but I've found that it saved my wrists,
and I'm so thankful for that.

### Logitech Trackman Marble Trackball Mouse

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Trackman-Marble-Four-Button-Programmable/dp/B001F42MKG/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=2PJ6MZIJINM3O&dchild=1&keywords=logitech+t-bc21&qid=1611548368&sprefix=logitech+t-%2Caps%2C151&sr=8-3&linkCode=li3&tag=mblayman-20&linkId=8855eca36e80d96510ee8a85aad2cb63&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B001F42MKG&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=mblayman-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mblayman-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B001F42MKG" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Continuing on my "save my wrists" theme,
I switched from a standard mouse to a trackball.
A trackball requires way less motion
of my arm
than a standard mouse.

This {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/39YtnwB" "Logitech Trackball Mouse" >}} has served me well for years.

### Blue Yeti Microphone

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=J9ZIS8QDFUP4&dchild=1&keywords=blue+yeti+microphone&qid=1611548587&sprefix=blue+ye%2Caps%2C168&sr=8-3&linkCode=li3&tag=mblayman-20&linkId=9541d6f7a5aea3b3f5f8dcf0add56d36&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1YPXW2&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=mblayman-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mblayman-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B00N1YPXW2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

This microphone is solid.
I used to use my {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/2NsXuoh" "Blue Yeti" >}}
for podcast recording,
but I found that the mic would pick up a small amount of background noise
(due to being a condensor microphone
and my lack of a perfectly quiet sound room).
In my opinion,
that makes the Blue Yeti perfect
for online meetings
like Google Meet.

I keep this mic near my monitor.
The mic stays out of the way
and provides some great audio
for all of my video calls.
For video calls,
it beats out my dynamic mic
(which I cover below)
because I don't have to have the microphone right up
to my face.

### ROVKING Earbuds

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H3CQ5ZG/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=li3&tag=mblayman-20&linkId=8f72217efa4fe5434637261541096826&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01H3CQ5ZG&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=mblayman-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mblayman-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B01H3CQ5ZG" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

If you're in enough online meetings,
you learn that you can massively reduce feedback
on the audio
by using some earbuds.

I love these {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3oaFCvj" "ROVKING Earbuds" >}} because:

* They are inexpensive.
* They fit very comfortably in my ear for hours on end.

The over the ear design means
that the earbuds don't have to be bulky
and stuffed hard in my ears.

## Podcasting

I produce a Django podcast
(which you can learn more about
in the sidebar).
Here's my critical gear
that I use
for my podcast.

### Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB Microphone

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2100x-USB-Cardioid-Microphone-ATR/dp/B07ZPBFVKK/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=3PMRQYJMJSN9I&dchild=1&keywords=atr+2100x+usb+microphone&qid=1611549512&sprefix=atr+2%2Caps%2C155&sr=8-5&linkCode=li3&tag=mblayman-20&linkId=1628352f258f2e0bce88eac38754a833&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZPBFVKK&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=mblayman-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mblayman-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B07ZPBFVKK" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I love my Blue Yeti,
but I also love this {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3iKfRk5" "Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB" >}}.
The greatest feature
of this microphone
is that it's a dynamic microphone.

That's an audio term,
and it essentially means
that I need to speak close
to the mic
to pick up the audio.
**How is that good?**
Well,
if you've got young kids,
you'll probably understand my response.

This mic is *fabulous* at avoiding background noise.
The audio is rich,
and my recordings don't have random noise
from my house
like a washing machine
or my kids being loud.

## Office Equipment

I also have some physical gear
that is super important
to the way
that I develop software.

### UPLIFT Desk

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Standing-Desk-Rectangular-Carbonized-Adjustable/dp/B07HS2BQ31/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=2Q2F9VTS110QH&dchild=1&keywords=uplift+desk&qid=1611585643&sprefix=uplift%2Caps%2C167&sr=8-7&linkCode=li3&tag=mblayman-20&linkId=67929e143969c7671675807472462186&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07HS2BQ31&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=mblayman-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mblayman-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B07HS2BQ31" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

*I have no desk chair.*

When I'm working,
I stand
at my {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/2YaH8CO" "UPLIFT Desk" >}} mostly.
I occasionally take standing breaks
and sit in an old La-Z-Boy recliner
that my dad gave me.

I really like the UPLIFT Desk
because I can preset some different heights
that the hydraulic controls can automatically adjust too.
With a single button push,
I can elevate my desk
to a better height
for video calls.

### Quartet Easel Whiteboard

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quartet-Adjustable-Whiteboard-Reversible-101EL/dp/B00006I9VJ/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=314EAHTT7LOP0&dchild=1&keywords=quartet+whiteboard&qid=1611586114&sprefix=quartet+whi%2Caps%2C164&sr=8-30&linkCode=li3&tag=mblayman-20&linkId=802d0a4084975ae3cc33ff0f6084912c&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00006I9VJ&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=mblayman-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mblayman-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B00006I9VJ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

My {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3pcXbMq" "Quartet Easel Whiteboard" >}}
is a very handy tool
for taking notes,
planning out code,
remembering important TODOs,
and thinking through tough problems.
Want to get *way* more utility
out of a whiteboard?
Then make sure
to get thin dry erase markers
like the {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3c8QlUt" "EXPO fine point markers" >}}.
Having thinner tips provides way more control
and gives you more workable space on your whiteboard.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/86074-Low-Odor-Markers-Assorted-4-Count/dp/B00006IFJ0/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=2YV1WGHZ2W5D6&dchild=1&keywords=expo+thin+dry+erase+markers+fine+tip&qid=1611586733&sprefix=expo+thin+dry+erase+markers+fin%2Caps%2C151&sr=8-38&linkCode=li3&tag=mblayman-20&linkId=2b5cbf8e82addb2b7c7485acd629f191&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00006IFJ0&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=mblayman-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mblayman-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B00006IFJ0" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

### Dot Matrix Notebook

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1441323716/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=li3&tag=mblayman-20&linkId=f8f9bc96cf8c7bc0966bbf325e61e826&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1441323716&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=mblayman-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mblayman-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=1441323716" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I write down a lot of things.
By writing down my thoughts,
it's easier to look back and relect.
I also think
that I can get my tasks out of my head
and prevent distractions.
A lot of people like moleskine notebooks,
but I went with a variant
of that.
My {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3ohtzMs" "Dot Matrix Notebook" >}}
functions like most other notebooks,
but it uses dots
on each page
so that I can draw whatever rectangular boundaries
that I want.
This is handy
for bullets, checkmarks,
and other nice flourishes
that keep my page tight and organized.

I also make sure that my lines are dark and clear.
{{< extlink "https://amzn.to/2Yc4Hv9" "Sakura Black Pigma Micron pens" >}}
are awesome when I do ink drawing,
but for my dot matrix notebook,
I prefer the bold line
from my {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3ahoGOT" "Pilot G2 bold point gel pens" >}}.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Retractable-Premium-Roller-Point/dp/B01G7SKKC6/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1&keywords=pilot+g2+bold&qid=1611587567&sr=8-43&linkCode=li3&tag=mblayman-20&linkId=49fff912195718846a530a1f1653fa92&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01G7SKKC6&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=mblayman-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mblayman-20&language=en_US&l=li3&o=1&a=B01G7SKKC6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

That's my gear!
