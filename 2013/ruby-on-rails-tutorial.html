  <h1>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</h1>

<p>If you don't know Ruby on Rails (RoR), this book <em>will</em> help you learn how to
develop a Rails web application.</p>
<p>I have read many tutorial books that are just terrible. Those books have
massive amounts of useless code with little explanation of what is going on.
Those authors aim for high page count so that the dead tree version can be
thicker to justify the high cost in a book store.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">RoR Tutorial</a> includes a lot of code, but
the code was well explained and felt meaningful. Additionally, the author,
Michael Hartl, is serious about Test Driven Development (TDD) so he includes a
lot of test code. The use of TDD might have been my favorite feature of the
book. While learning about data modeling, templates, and app logic, Hartl
shows you how to test those things. The benefits to this are twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>You learn how to do software testing (a skill that is very lacking in the
   software industry).</li>
<li>You have tests to help you verify that your local version works the same
   way as the app in the book.</li>
</ol>
<p>I could enumerate all the topics that Hartl covers in Rails, but the book is
online so it would be better to just go read the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">table of
contents</a>. I'm not
a seasoned RoR developer so I don't know how exhaustive he truly was, but the
content seemed pretty thorough to me.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a very good introduction to the Ruby on Rails world. You
don't have to be a pro at Ruby. And you don't have to be a pro at web
development. The Ruby on Rails Tutorial is a good book for those that want to
move from a beginner's level of experience to an intermediate level.</p>
