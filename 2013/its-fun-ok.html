  <h1>It's fun -&gt; ok!</h1>
<p class='byline'>By <a href='/'>Matt Layman</a> on August 5, 2013</p>

<p>As a programming book junky, I love seeing fun stuff because even my odd taste
in literature can be curbed by material that is super dry.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon &ldquo;<a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com/content">learn you some Erlang for great
good!</a>&rdquo; (lysefgg) after doing
research on what resources were available for understanding the popular
functional language. Even though I&rsquo;m still in the middle of the book, the
author has done a great job so far of explaining Erlang and why Erlang&rsquo;s
features are so cool.</p>
<p>My primary work experience is not in functional languages. I have spent most of
my time with Python, C, C++, Java, C# and the like so my brain is accustomed to
non-functional languages. Erlang fascinates me not only because of its killer
features like handling concurrency but also because of how it solves problems.
The mental leap required to program primarily with recursion and single
assignment variables stretches my thinking, enabling me to apply different
kinds of techniques to problems.</p>
<p>Learning and stretching are why I read these kinds of books. If you&rsquo;re looking
for a different way of thinking about programming, look at a functional
language. Erlang, Lisp, Haskell, or Clojure would all be great choices. lysefgg
is freely available to read online or you can get the dead tree version. Who
knows, you might even have fun().</p>
