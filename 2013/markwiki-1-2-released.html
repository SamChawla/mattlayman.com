  <h1>MarkWiki 1.2 released... now actually somewhat useful</h1>
<h5>By <a href='/'>Matt Layman</a> on November 3, 2013</h5>
<p>My pet project, MarkWiki, has reached a point of maturity where other people
may actually be interested in using it. I started writing MarkWiki back in May
as a way to keep my Python skills sharp, but it appears to be a capable tool
now.</p>
<p>MarkWiki is a wiki that uses the Markdown plain text formatting language.
Markdown let's you do things in plain text like adding * to a word like
*boom* to italicize it. The source text gets converted into pretty HTML.</p>
<p>In this release, I added user authentication so not every person on the
Internet can delete anything they want on your MarkWiki site. The release also
incorporates Bootstrap 3 so all pages are now completely mobile responsive.</p>
<p>You can check out the docs at
<a href="http://pythonhosted.org/MarkWiki/">http://pythonhosted.org/MarkWiki/</a> or lend
a hand on <a href="https://github.com/mblayman/markwiki">GitHub</a>. Other features for
the release are in the release notes.</p>
<p>Or... if you're like me, you can play around with it:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>pip install MarkWiki
</pre></div>
