> Have you ever received a gift
that fundamentally changes your path
in life?

For the Christmas of 1990,
I got the best and most influential suprise gift
of my life:
a *Nintendo Entertainment System*.
Twenty seven years later,
I still recall the shock and joy
of unwrapping the Nintendo,
with its included orange zapper light gun
and the Super Mario Bros./Duck Hunt combination cartridge.
My grandmother surprised even my parents,
who were not super keen on the idea
of my owning a video game system at the time.

The memories I have of childhood are deeply entwined
with that console.

I played Mario relentlessly.
My little seven-year-old hands wrapped around
that rectangular controller,
mastering jump timings
and racing through level after level
to save the princess
from fire breathing King Koopa.
While I sat squarely in front
of the television
in a kid's rocking chair,
my toddler brother "played" too,
holding the second controller upside down
(and unplugged).

In those early years,
I'd sometimes watch my dad,
who would not claim to be any type of gamer,
shoot down clay pidgeons
from Duck Hunt's skeet shooting mode.
He was great at that game
and I admired his skills
(and, no, he wasn't holding the light gun right up
against the screen).

Over time,
my collection of games grew to include
Zelda,
Final Fantasy,
TMNT,
NES Football,
and many others.
Each of these games holds some part
of my memory.
The games infected my other loves
in life
like drawing.
I would sketch all the characters
that I played with,
use graph paper to recreate pixel-perfect sprites,
and daydream
about the fantasy worlds
that the games crafted.

As I grew older,
my love for playing extended
into a desire to create.
I decided,
like many other kids my age,
that I wanted to make videogames
as my job.
I read Nintendo Power
and learned about schools like [DigiPen](https://www.digipen.edu/)
and aimed for that path.
With my neighborhood buddies,
we explored some game development systems
like [MegaZuex](http://vault.digitalmzx.net/index.php),
and I fantasized about creating my own Street Fighter clone.
This desire to create games pushed me toward math
and pushed me to excel in school,
knowing that I would need that if I wanted to make games.

All of this influence directed me
to a Computer Engineering degree
at the University of Virginia.
I learned how computers work,
how software is created,
and so much more.
The course of my life has steered away from game development
(though I recently made a [Pong](https://github.com/mblayman/pong) game for fun),
but I still credit my path
to that little grey box
that appeared before my eyes
on that Christmas many years ago.

Last week,
my grandmother passed away,
surrounded by those who loved her.
She was dear to me,
and I'm forever grateful
for the influence that she had on my life,
not only for the Nintendo,
but for the person that she was,
and the son that she raised that I am proud to call my father.

Goodbye, Grandma.
I love you and I'll miss you.
