At October's Python Frederick presentation,
I looked at 5 popular Python web frameworks
and discussed the benefits and tradeoffs
of each of these tools.
The video is available on YouTube
for you to view.

These were the 5 web frameworks that we compared:

* [API Star](https://github.com/encode/apistar)
* [Falcon](http://falconframework.org/)
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Pyramid](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/)

The presentation material is available
in the [Python Frederick talks repository](https://github.com/python-frederick/talks/tree/master/2017-10-web-frameworks).

Additionally,
the sample code for each framework can be downloaded
from GitHub
in a specific [web frameworks repository](https://github.com/mblayman/web-framework-shootout).
