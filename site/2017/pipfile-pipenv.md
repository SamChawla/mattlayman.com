Last month,
I wrote
in detail
about [the new Pipfile format
and the pipenv tool](https://www.mattlayman.com/2017/using-pipfile-for-fun-and-profit.html)
for managing Python packages.
I presented about Pipfiles
in depth
at Python Frederick this month.

If audio and video is more your speed,
we recorded a talk
for the first time
at Python Frederick,
and I posted it to YouTube
for your enjoyment.
