My name is Matt and I create software. I have a few [open source
projects](#projects), [work at a startup](#work), [love my
family](#family), and [go to church](#church).

I also do typical stuff on the Internet. You can find me on
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/+MattLayman/posts) or
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mblayman).
If you are looking for my professional details,

On occasion, [I write on various topics](/archive.html).

<a name='projects'></a>
## Open Source

With my limited free time, I pursue my interest in open source software. Most
of my time is spent on projects of my own creation.

### handroll

[handroll](http://handroll.github.io) is a tool to help build websites
similar to this one. When there is a limited range of material and a simple
design, handroll generates a website easily. [Check it out on
GitHub.](https://github.com/mblayman/handroll)

### MarkWiki

I was stuck with a crummy wiki at my previous [work](#work)
(\*cough\* SharePoint \*cough\*), so I tried my hand at creating a non-crummy
one. The result is MarkWiki, a Markdown based wiki that is simple
to set up. [It is on GitHub too.](https://github.com/mblayman/markwiki)

### tappy

Automated software testing is generally useful and enlightened programmers will
at least do some of it. The [Test Anything Protocol
(TAP)](http://testanything.org/) is a way to track those automated results. TAP
is so simple that any language could create a TAP generator very quickly. I
wrote a TAP generator for Python that hooks in with Python's `unittest` module.
[Guess what? It's on GitHub.](https://github.com/mblayman/tappy)


<a name='work'></a>
## Work

<img class='book' src='storybird.png' width='60' height='60'>

I work at [Storybird](https://storybird.com). Storybird makes it possible for
people to share creative stories through book and poetry writing. I am a
software engineer with the opportunity to make Storybird an even better place
to share stories. I get to write Python every day and help make the Internet
more awesome.

<img class='book' src='lm.png' width='302' height='62'>

[Lockheed Martin](http://lockheedmartin.com/) was my employer. While there, I
worked on a wide range of products. You might have heard of some of them, like
[GPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#Control_segment)
or [satellite phones](http://www.iridium.com/about/iridiumnext.aspx). I also
gained experience with Modeling and Simulation software, web applications, and
complex configuration management implementations.

<a name='family'></a>
## Family

I am a family man. I consider myself blessed to have a loving wife, Elease, and
two great kids, Mark and Faye. My children are very young so my life is a
little hectic, but that's perfectly fine with me.

<a name='church'></a>
## Church

I am a Christian, and I attend [New Hope OPC](http://newhopeopc.org/). My hope
is that my faith reflects on all of my behavior, and that I show kindness,
humility, and love.
