My dad taught me
that if I took care of my tools,
they would serve me well
and last a lifetime.
**Software tools are no different.**
If you give them attention,
they will serve you well.

Our primary tools as software craftsmen are
text editors,
shells,
and version control systems.
These tools are refined
via *dotfiles*.
dotfiles are those files and directories
on your computer
that often begin with a `.`
and hold configuration settings
for softare.
`.bashrc` is a well known dotfile
that stores settings for `bash`
like a custom `PATH`
or short aliases for frequently used commands.

Careful attention to your dotfiles
unleashes the full power of your tools.
With my dotfiles and two keystrokes,
I can run a full test suite
or a single unit test
or search my entire project
in a split second.
By studying these configuration files,
you learn all the options
that are available to you.

*How do I start taking advantage of these files?*,
you might ask.
Look at how other craftsmen do it.
[http://dotfiles.github.io/](http://dotfiles.github.io/)
is a great resource to start.
This site contains plenty of example user repositories
and a collection of tools to control dotfiles
to get you going.
If you use Vim, Zsh, or Git,
you can take a peek at what I've done
to [my dotfiles](https://github.com/mblayman/dotfiles)
(you may also learn something even if you **don't** use those tools).

Don't chop down your next software project
with a dull axe.
*Hone your software tools.*
