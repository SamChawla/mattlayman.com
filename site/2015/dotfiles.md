Something my dad taught me as a kid was to use the right tool for the job.
To know the right tool,
you have to understand your tools
and you need to *have* the right tool.
For carpentry,
collecting the right tools can be an expensive proposition.
For software,
collecting the right tools is a matter of research and time.
