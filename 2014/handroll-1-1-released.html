  <h1>handroll 1.1 released</h1>
<h5>By <a href='/'>Matt Layman</a> on June 1, 2014</h5>
<p>I have released the 1.1 version of my static website generator. This version
contains quite a few new features which are documented in the <a href="http://handroll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/releases.html#version-1-1-released-june-1-2014">release
history</a>. Essentially, the 1.1 release adds the level of polish that
users should probably expect from a product.</p>
<p>The features included in this releases were driven by what I actually needed
for this website. This includes code highlighting, file skipping, and handling
for non-ASCII characters (thanks Ã˜MQ book!).</p>
<p>Under the hood, I added support for a plugin architecture so that anyone can
write plugins for handroll.</p>
<p>Finally, I added documentation at <a href="http://handroll.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Read the
Docs</a> and introduced better testing
with <a href="https://travis-ci.org/mblayman/handroll">Travis CI</a>. These were added
because of lessons learned from other projects.</p>
<p>You can download handroll from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/handroll">PyPI</a> or
install it with:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>pip install handroll
</pre></div>
