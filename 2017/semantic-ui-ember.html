  <h1>Semantic UI in Ember</h1>
<p class='byline'>By <a href='/'>Matt Layman</a> on March 21, 2017</p>
<p><img class='book' src='ember.png'></p>
<p>For my SaaS app,
<a href="https://www.collegeconductor.com/">College Conductor</a>,
I made the choice to use
<a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>
to power the frontend web client.
I also decided to use
<a href="https://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a>
as the UI toolkit
to build the look and feel
of the site.
Integrating the two projects
into a single product
proved to be harder than I anticipated.
Let&rsquo;s look at why that happened.</p>
<p>My first decision when evaluating Semantic UI
led me to consider
if a viable Ember add-on existed.
The official Semantic UI project
points to
<a href="http://semantic-org.github.io/Semantic-UI-Ember/#/modules">Semantic-UI-Ember</a>
as the default answer
for working with Semantic
in Ember.
Ultimately,
I concluded that the add-on wasn&rsquo;t right
for me.
Semantic-UI-Ember wraps many of Semantic&rsquo;s elements and views
into Ember components.
While I appreciate what they are trying to do,
I didn&rsquo;t really like that my project would always lag
behind the latest Semantic UI releases,
and that there was a whole extra layer of API
to learn.
The thought of bouncing between two different sets
of documentation
for my UI toolkit
did not appeal to me
at all.</p>
<p>After I ruled out Semantic-UI-Ember,
I decided to integrate the toolkit myself.
Semantic has packages that are available
via <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>
in a variety of flavors.
Semantic is built with the
<a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less</a> CSS preprocessor.
My goal was to make sure
that I could work with the Less-based files
and integrate into Ember&rsquo;s toolchain.
Because of that goal,
I chose the <code>semantic-ui-less</code> package.
This package offers all of the Semantic files
without its normal
<a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> build process.
My logic was that Ember&rsquo;s Less integration
could build my Semantic theme
and be a seamless part
of my development workflow.
<em>Reality was not so kind.</em></p>
<p>The biggest problem that I experienced
with <code>semantic-ui-less</code>
related to the project&rsquo;s expectations
about file locations.
The Less files from the package were stored
in the <code>node_modules</code> directory of my project.
Ember&rsquo;s tooling could handle this location,
but Semantic itself did not fare well.
I had a devilish time trying to convince Semantic
of the location of my theme.
Even when it did find the theme,
the paths weren&rsquo;t quite right
for Semantic to use its overriding mechanism properly.
The fallout of that
was that I had to directly modify the theme
to get the styling that I wanted.
I felt stuck with a mediocre integration.
To make matters worse,
the Ember development server would sometimes throw errors
when I changed a Less file.
I&rsquo;d have to restart the development server
and lose the benefit of having it integrated.</p>
<p>I finally decided to keep my use of Semantic separate
from my Ember toolchain.
By switching to the <code>semantic-ui</code> package,
I could get the Gulp toolchain
that the project expects.
My Semantic files get stored
in my app&rsquo;s <code>vendor</code> directory
and I set the Ember configuration
to pull in Semantic&rsquo;s built version.
Making this switch resulted
in a less integrated experience,
but it dramatically simplified working with the two projects.</p>
<p>My lesson with this process
is to be wary of immediately trying to integrate two technologies,
especially when you&rsquo;re not experienced with <em>either</em>
when you start.
By keeping the projects separated,
I now have additional complexity
in my deployment process.
Thankfully, my Ansible scripts can readily handle that
so I&rsquo;m ok with the tradeoff.
This whole experience is an example
of where I failed to follow some sage advice,
<em><a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork">do the simplest thing that could possibly work</a></em>.</p>
