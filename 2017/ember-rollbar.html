  <h1>Monitor Ember app errors with Rollbar</h1>

<p>One fact that I&rsquo;ve come to accept
as an experienced developer
is that errors <em>will</em> happen.
Guaranteed.
The reasons for this situation
are vast.
Perhaps there are quirks
in a browser you didn&rsquo;t test.
Or perhaps the user did something
that you didn&rsquo;t plan for.
You can&rsquo;t anticipate every situation.
Knowing that errors will happen means you have two choices.
You can ignore this fact
and let your users suffer
(at the risk of losing them).
Or,
<strong>you can record these errors
and fix them
to improve your application.</strong>
I recently set up Rollbar
for <a href="https://www.collegeconductor.com/">College Conductor</a>
and wanted to share my experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://rollbar.com/">Rollbar</a>
is a service
that let&rsquo;s you record your errors
<em>wherever</em> they happen.
Error information is stored
with your Rollbar account
so you can examine a problem
and decide how to fix it.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re developing an Ember application,
you can quickly integrate your app
with Rollbar. Let&rsquo;s see how.
Begin by installing an Ember CLI addon
for Rollbar:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ ember install ember-cli-rollbar
</pre></div>


<p>Once the addon is installed,
it needs to be configured
to communicate
with Rollbar.
In your <code>config/environment.js</code> file,
add a section like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">ENV</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">rollbar</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">accessToken</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;your post_client_item token&#39;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Rollbar has a few different tokens
available on your access tokens settings page.
The correct one to use with Ember
is the <code>post_client_item</code> token.</p>
<p>With that configuration done,
you&rsquo;re ready to go!
When the Ember app is not in <code>development</code> mode,
errors will be reported to Rollbar.</p>
<p>Good luck with your app.
I hope this information helps you improve
your project
for your users.
In a few mere weeks of use,
Rollbar has already helped me
track down a number of problems.
I&rsquo;m sure it can do the same for you.</p>
