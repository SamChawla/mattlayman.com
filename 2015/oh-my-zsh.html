  <h1>Oh, my shell? Oh My Zsh</h1>

<p>Do you ever think about what program is running your terminal?
For a long time,
I knew the answer for most Linux / OS X systems was <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a>,
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29">shell</a> program.
<em>But what else is available?</em></p>
<p>Aside from the occasional script,
I didn't pay much attention to bash.
bash helped me get around my computer
and autocomplete stuff,
and that felt like enough.
This was <strong>profoundly</strong> shortsighted.</p>
<p>Heavy command line users should think about their shell.
I finally devoted time to shell research,
and I became a <a href="http://www.zsh.org/">Zsh</a> convert.</p>
<p>Zsh is the power user's weapon of choice.
It has an amazing <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jaguardesignstudio/why-zsh-is-cooler-than-your-shell-16194692">set of features</a> that go far beyond bash.
For example, <code>cd ~/p/h</code> followed by a tab
will quickly expand to <code>cd ~/projects/handroll/</code>
on my computer.
Zsh is smart enough to determine what you mean
when you want to change directories
so you can type fewer characters.</p>
<p>On top of Zsh being awesome, it also has some great tools
to extend its awesomeness.
One popular tool for the shell is <a href="http://ohmyz.sh/">Oh My Zsh</a>.
OMZ offers many plugins and themes that make Zsh excel even more.
I've added the <code>git</code> and <code>virtualenvwrapper</code> plugins to my setup,
and they've already been a huge boon.
There are hundreds more.</p>
<p>Want to try out Zsh? Go for it with these commands:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo apt-get install zsh
<span class="nv">$ </span>chsh -s /bin/zsh <span class="c"># Change shell to zsh.</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>curl -L <span class="se">\</span>
    https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh <span class="p">|</span> sh
</pre></div>
