<p><em>Your brain is far more elastic
than you give it credit for.</em></p>
<p>A few years ago,
my dentist told me
that I was damaging my gums
by brushing too hard.
He advised me to switch hands
when I brushed my teeth.
Valuing my teeth and my health,
I began to use my other hand.
It was awkward.
It was challenging.
And it worked
to prevent me
from trying too hard&hellip;
for a while.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next few months,
I witnessed my brushing awkwardness disappear.
Those annoying spots to reach were suddenly easy.
Fine motions that take careful control were doable.
I became adept with either hand.</p>
<p>What was evident to me was that it&rsquo;s possible to do anything
with practice.
Too often,
we sell ourselves short.
We think we&rsquo;re incapable of doing <em>that one thing</em>.
We don&rsquo;t try
because of how convinced we are.</p>
<p>Well,
I think we&rsquo;re lying to ourselves.</p>
<p>We have the same frustration
that I see in my young son
when he can&rsquo;t color in the lines perfectly.
The difference with him
is that he is constantly encouraged to keep trying.
In that trying,
he gets better.
His practice is continuous.
<em>That one thing</em> that was impossible for him becomes possible.
<strong>Like children, our practice should be continuous</strong>.</p>
<p>As for my gums,
perhaps I should learn to brush
<em>with my feet</em>.</p>
