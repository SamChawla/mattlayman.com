  <h1>dotfiles: Hone your software tools</h1>

<p>My dad taught me
that if I took care of my tools,
they would serve me well
and last a lifetime.
<strong>Software tools are no different.</strong>
If you give them attention,
they will serve you well.</p>
<p>Our primary tools as software craftsmen are
text editors,
shells,
and version control systems.
These tools are refined
via <em>dotfiles</em>.
dotfiles are those files and directories
on your computer
that often begin with a <code>.</code>
and hold configuration settings
for softare.
<code>.bashrc</code> is a well known dotfile
that stores settings for <code>bash</code>
like a custom <code>PATH</code>
or short aliases for frequently used commands.</p>
<p>Careful attention to your dotfiles
unleashes the full power of your tools.
With my dotfiles and two keystrokes,
I can run a full test suite
or a single unit test
or search my entire project
in a split second.
By studying these configuration files,
you learn all the options
that are available to you.</p>
<p><em>How do I start taking advantage of these files?</em>,
you might ask.
Look at how other craftsmen do it.
<a href="http://dotfiles.github.io/">http://dotfiles.github.io/</a>
is a great resource to start.
This site contains plenty of example user repositories
and a collection of tools to control dotfiles
to get you going.
If you use Vim, Zsh, or Git,
you can take a peek at what I&rsquo;ve done
to <a href="https://github.com/mblayman/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>
(you may also learn something even if you <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> use those tools).</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t chop down your next software project
with a dull axe.
<em>Hone your software tools.</em></p>
