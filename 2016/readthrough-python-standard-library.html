  <h1>Reading through the Python standard library</h1>
<p class='byline'>By <a href='/'>Matt Layman</a> on July 29, 2016</p>
<p><img class='book' src='library.jpg'></p>
<p>A couple of years ago I decided to read the entire Python standard library.
A few months back, I finished.</p>
<p>What I learned is this:
<strong>while there is some interesting &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; stuff in there,
you don&rsquo;t need to do this to become proficient.</strong></p>
<p>Did you know that nearly all the HTTP status codes are in the standard library?
Judging by all the Python packages that defined their own status codes,
I assumed that the codes weren&rsquo;t in there.
I was <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/httplib.html">wrong</a>.
And they got <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.html#http-status-codes">better in 3.5</a>.
Reading through the library revealed many &ldquo;easter eggs&rdquo; like that.</p>
<p>Even though learning about those hidden corners
of the standard library is fun,
there&rsquo;s a really large problem with reading through the whole library.</p>
<h3>It&rsquo;s a lack of context.</h3>
<p>One challenge of reading through everything is that you may be unaware
of what parts are excellent (like <code>os.path</code>)
and what parts are not (I won&rsquo;t name names here).
Occasionally,
the reader is given a warning about the dragons ahead.
You might find a tip to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html">requests</a>.
I think those kinds of suggestions are rare.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re asking:</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<em>So if the library doesn&rsquo;t provide much direction, what do I do?</em>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Part of getting good with the standard library is experiential.
The best ways to gain that experience is through practice and exposure.
This is where I point you to the community.</p>
<p>Your local Python user group (hi, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/python-frederick/">Python Frederick</a>!),
online Python communities like on IRC,
and open source Python projects
are excellent places to get exposure.
You&rsquo;ll encounter people who can provide pointers
and read code from those who are a bit farther on this journey than you are.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s tough for you to get into those social groups,
maybe <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/">The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Python</a>
will work for you.
For folks that have a programming background,
I can also recommend <a href="http://www.diveintopython3.net/">Dive Into Python 3</a>.
I got my start with the Python 2 version
and can attest that it&rsquo;s a good resource.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re tempted to read through the standard library like I was,
<strong>cool! Best of luck!</strong>
Please don&rsquo;t forget that there are people around you
that can help provide that missing context.</p>
