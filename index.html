  <h1>Matt Layman</h1>
  <p>My name is Matt and I create software. I have a few <a href="#projects">open source
projects</a>, <a href="#work">work for a big company</a>, <a href="#family">love my
family</a>, and <a href="#church">go to church</a>.</p>
<p>I also do typical stuff on the Internet. You can find me there.</p>
<p>On occasion, <a href="/archive.html">I write on various topics.</a></p>
<p><a name='projects'></a></p>
<h2>Open Source</h2>
<p>With my limited free time, I pursue my interest in open source software. Most
of my time is spent on projects of my own creation.</p>
<h3>handroll</h3>
<p><code>handroll</code> is a tool to help build websites similar to this one. When there is
a limited range of material and a simple design, <code>handroll</code> generates a website
easily. <a href="https://github.com/mblayman/handroll">Check it out on GitHub.</a></p>
<h3>MarkWiki</h3>
<p>I was stuck with a crummy wiki at <a href="#work">work</a> (*cough*SharePoint*cough*),
so I tried my hand at creating a non-crummy one. The result is <code>MarkWiki</code>: a
Markdown based wiki that is simple to set up. <a href="https://github.com/mblayman/markwiki">It is on GitHub
too.</a></p>
<h3>tappy</h3>
<p>Automated software testing is generally useful and enlightened programmers will
at least do some of it. The <a href="http://testanything.org/">Test Anything Protocol
(TAP)</a> is a way to track those automated results. TAP
is so simple that any language could create a TAP generator very quickly. I
wrote a TAP generator for Python that hooks in with Python's <code>unittest</code> module.

<p>TODO: I'm not done yet.</p>
